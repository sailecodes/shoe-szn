### Top-level

| Frontend | Backend      | API     | Database   |
| -------- | ------------ | ------- | ---------- |
| React    | Node/Express | GraphQL | PostgreSQL |

### Bottom-level

The frontend relies on a `React` framework powered by `Vite`. Moreover, multiple packages support the frontend, including `@tanstack/react-query`, `react-router-dom`, `apollo-client`, and `sass`. The client also delegates all client-server interactions to `Apollo Client` in order to communicate with the `GraphQL API` embedded within the `Express` server.

The backend, as mentioned, is a `Node`/`Express` server.
